# calculator
A simple* JavaScript calculator.

## Features

*   Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo)
*   Refuse to continue operations that contain errors.
*   Operator persistance, when equals is pressed repeadedly, runs the previous operation with the second operand repeatedly. IE 2 + 3 + 3 + 3
*   Easter Egg, open the terminal and type createCalculator(). All rendered calculators have their own logic and operate independently.
*   Memory add, recall, and clear feature. Saves the current entry into a variable. Memoray can be recalled and modified later, or cleared. Operates seperately from calculator clear function, so that you may save a value, clear your calculator, and reuse it. Currently no indicator, future plan.
